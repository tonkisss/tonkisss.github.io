        History of Chinese New Year
      </h2>
      <p>
        Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, is the most important traditional holiday in China. It is celebrated at the turn of the Chinese calendar, which usually falls between January 21 and February 20.
      </p>
      <p>
        The origins of Chinese New Year can be traced back to ancient China, where it was originally a celebration of the end of winter and the arrival of spring. Over time, it evolved into a festival to honor ancestors and deities, and to ward off evil spirits.
